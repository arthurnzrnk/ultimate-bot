"""Strategy router.

The router encapsulates the logic for selecting which strategy to use
depending on the current trading mode. In our design, the user toggles
between scalping (1m) and trend following (1h) modes, so the router simply
returns the appropriate strategy instance. To add more complex regime
detection or multiâ€‘strategy allocation, extend this class to incorporate
additional selection logic.
